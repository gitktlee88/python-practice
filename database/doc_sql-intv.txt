- Normalization? -
It is a systematic approach of decomposing tables to eliminate data
redundancy(repetition) and undesirable characteristics
like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies.

1NF: - to avoid redundancy by breaking down the table.
    - to be Atomic like User table.
         user_id, fn, ln, email, address

2NF: - (should be in 1NF) and to remove partial dependency with composit keys.

3NF: - (should be in 1NF, 2NF) and to remove transitive dependency.
    - it simplyfy the queries.

- Data Warehousing? -
A data warehouse is a copy of transaction data specifically structured
for query and analysis. The purpose of database warehousing is to provide aggregate data 
which is suitable for decision making.

CREATE TABLE employee (emp_id INT, fname VARCHAR(25), lname VARCHAR(25),
           gender CHAR, dept_id INT, salary INT);
ALTER TABLE employee modify emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY;

CREATE TABLE department(id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(25));
ALTER TABLE department change name dept_name varchar(25);

ALTER TABLE TABLE_NAME ADD INDEX (COLUMN_NAME);

/* return employee record with max salary */

SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE salary = (select Max(salary) from employee);

/* select 2nd highest salary in employee */
SELECT Max(salary)
FROM employee
WHERE salary Not In (select Max(salary) from employee);

/* select range of employee based on id */

SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE emp_id between 2004 and 2007;

/* return employee name, highest salary and department */

SELECT e.fname, e.lname, e.salary, d.dept_name
FROM employee e
INNER JOIN department d
ON (e.dept_id = d.dept_id)
WHERE salary IN (select Max(salary) from employee);

/* return employee name, highest salary and department for each department*/


SELECT e.fname, e.lname, e.salary, d.dept_name
FROM employee e
INNER JOIN department d
ON (e.dept_id = d.dept_id)
WHERE salary IN (select Max(salary) from employee GROUP BY
dept_id);
